# Hey, I'm zilla

This site serves as the objectively best subjective ranking of *ALL* [Pretty Much It](https://prettymuch.it/about/) commentary/watchalongs.

I threw this together after joking that I've never seen a single video from Pretty Much It, despite living with someone who is an uber fan. After not getting a solid answer of what the best and least-best videos were to make my first and second views, I decided I should ~~waste~~ invest my time as an unbiased party ranking every produced track from the beginning.

> "No fucking way, have you seen the size of the [tracklist](https://prettymuch.it/tracks/)?"

Yeah - and now I have to follow through on this project out of spite just to prove you wrong. But, _don't_ expect this to be a fast process. Or even close. I'm initially thinking of aiming for ~two/three tracks a week. I could shoot for more, but would need to split the viewing into multiple sessions instead of one singular sitting, which I'd like to avoid "for the experience".

I'm thinking of using a 0-10 ranking system, where 0 is insulting and impressively bad, and 10 is a historical masterpiece. The commentary/watchalong track will recieve a score, as will the movie/episode it is based on, so that I can track overall rankings of material vs Pretty Much It tracks.

If you disagree with any of my rankings, tough shit, [I'm right, you're wrong, shutup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aboe6D-k9Fc).
