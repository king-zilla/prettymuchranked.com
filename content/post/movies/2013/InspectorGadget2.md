### Score

* **Inspector Gadget 2: 1.8/10**
  * 2003 effects ~~weren't terribly bad~~ were 2003 effects, used distastefully, too.
    * I initially started at not bad, but as the movie went on, it just continually rolled downhill. 
  * BRING BACK MATHEW BRODERICK WTF
  * Joke writing and delivery equally terrible.
  * All around terrible acting and directing.
  * Fade out to black, in an uninterupted movie...?
  * The "new and upgraded" G2 inspector... oof.
  * Where is Claw's face?? 

* **Commentary: 3/10**
  * Most of thoughts are applicable so not going to reiterate here.
  * First ever commentary, still no idea who Eric is, or Mike, or PMI for that matter. I guess that's not this track's responsibility, but, still kinda docking it for it; tough shit, [I'm right, you're wrong, shutup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aboe6D-k9Fc).

### Thoughts

* First track ever, what am I getting myself into...
* Wow, Eric talks kinda fast, gosh damn I can't even type as fast as he's talking
* Syncing the movie up was an adventure
* _Who's Mike???_
* Weird flex that they're doing Inspector Gadget 2, with no previous uploading of the first one ???
   * They've both apparently seen the first one, yet still, here we are, starting with the second one
* Eric (not) admitting to thinking of doing non-legal things (drugs, cocaine): 1
* Eric (not) admitting to thinking of doing non-legal things (insinuating **A CHILD** doing, uh, bad things): 2
* Eric's villian plans are terrible, he'd be a horrible villian (_double A batteries?_)
* "If they made this today, the effects would be better" -- who would of thought, a 2003 movie's effect's would be better in 2013
* "Now is this funny for kids?" - Mike, asking the important questions. No - this is terrible, for everyone.
* Eric, stop spoiling things while the movie is running
* That was a peaceful moment of silence where it was edited out; mmmm, yeah, that was nice.
  * Followed immedaitely with **"I'M GONNA FUCK YOU WITH MY DICK"**, welp.
* _"Brown people"_, yikes
* Is Eric always this sexual/horny??? Gosh damn
* The occasional ASMR is nice, particularly "Holy fuck I want a donut"; nice job, Mike.
* ERIC STOP SPOILING THINGS WHILE THE MOVIE IS RUNNING
* I asked about why there's a hot dog at the mcdonald's first; Zilla:1 Eric: 0
* Eric (not) admitting to thinking of doing non-legal things (curbstomping a beautiful puppy): 3
* Your face is mostly definitely **not** 20% of your face, Eric. What are we, flies?
* Eric (not) admitting to thinking of doing non-legal things (NOW STRAIGHT UP SHOOTING THE PUPPY IN THE FACE; the absolute gall of this man): 4
* Checks out that Eric tried calling the Ghostbusters hotline as a child.
   * "So was that the worst part of your childhood?" ... "No, probably the raping"; Yikes again.
* Eric was _really_ dedicated to this throat slitting bit 
* Eric (not) admitting to thinking of doing non-legal things (slitting G2's throat bc she was happy to see Gadget 1): 5
