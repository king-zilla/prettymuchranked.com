### Score

* **The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure**: pre-watch guess **2/10** || **Post-watch score: 0.1/10**
  * "2012 American interactive educational children's musical adventure comedy film"
     * This movie cost like $60 million to make and grossed like, $445,000 opening weekend at ~2,200 theaters (like $200 a theater), so...
     * Would be closer to 0.0 but somehow the human cast in the movie was for some reason kind of impressive, maybe that's why the $20 million budget though
     * WHY IS THE MOVIE SO LONG WTF IT GOES ON _FOREVER_
  * Interactive, but not-live action movie? Strange decision
     * Voice actor/singing was at least pretty decent
  * Some of the Ooogies(?) were pretty scary looking
  * The whole plot of the movie is centered around hunting 25 cent balloons (for a pillow???) that could've just been replaced...?
  * The whole musical part in the tree-pot was rough and the old lady definitely didn't know _any_ of the words
  * Why is the song about clearing your throat while you have the Flu so... sensual?
  * Is the Cowboy's voice dubbed over???

* **Commentary: 8.1/10**
  * Most of thoughts are applicable so not going to reiterate here.
  * Pretty funny, but this one needed a video watch-along, I need to see Eric dancing to every stand up part
  * Quality sing and dance along material, but again, we need the video!
  * Commentary was pretty tangential from the movie at times though even for watchalong standards so docking points for that
  * THEY EDITED OUT THE CLIMAX OF THE MOVIE ERIC WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS

* We need proof that Eric was standing and dancing, someone needs to surface this video
* Eric (not) admitting to thinking of doing non-legal things ("We can molest him and he'll NEVER KNOW"): **8**.

* "He just put like a little green dildo in his mouth, what was that???" It was most definitely a pickle, Eric, c'mon
* "Ooogielove, Oogielove! _**STEALYOURPARENTSMONEY STEALYOURPARENTSMONEY**_"
* So many Saw references that I don't understand, oh well
* Release the Oogieloves Eric Striffler cut, Eric
* > Mike: "What if you had like a serious problem, like what is it uhm.. tourette's? And watched a movie like this? It'd be very offensive"

  > Eric (serious): "...If you had Tourette's?"
  >
  > Mike: "Wait no what am I thinking of?? ... Parkinson's!"
  >
  > Eric: "OH HAHAHAHAHA NOW IT'S FUCKING FUNNY!!"
* The kissing that devolved into sexual grunting (and licking?? choking? I don't even know), oh my...

* "Any of you guys feel like _fucking_?" - Mike
