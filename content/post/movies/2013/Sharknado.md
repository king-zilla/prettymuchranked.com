### Score

* **Sharknado**: Pre movie guess: **3.4/10** || **Post-watch score: 1.85/10** 
   * 2013 film, this would of gotten a much worse rating if the movie took itself serious, which this clearly didn't
   * For some reason the color (filter?) makes this just seem like its trying to be a Zack Snyder movie
   * When did the sharks get sucked up? Did they really only show that in the first 3 milliseconds?
   * Why was there so many boobs in the start of this movie?
   * I legitimately think I could achieve some of these effect shots
   * _Global warming = Sharknado_?
   * Why is every single beach shot a perfectly sunny pristine day
   * The stock clips and footage were bad bad, and I'm also 90% convinced one of the videos was an actual Huricane Katrina clip.
   * Almost every single death could of (easily) been avoided with literally a single shred of intelligence.
   * If a bunch of sharks were carried ALL THE WAY FROM THE OCEAN in a tornado, would it not just be a ton of flying carcasses? How the fuck are those things still alive?

* **Commentary: 5.7/10**
  * Most of thoughts are applicable so not going to reiterate here.
  * First track with Jake, who seems cool. Mic was a bit quiet which was really the only way I could tell the difference between him and Mike at first.
  * They raised a lot of valid issues I also had with the movie/plot/directing/scenes/etc.
  * Everytime shark voice parody was golden.
  * Laughed a good amount in general
  * Docking points because two tracks watched and still 2 tracks with r*pe jokes.

### Thoughts

> Previously...
> * Eric (not) admitting to thinking of doing non-legal things: **5**.

* Eric, Mike (Frank?), and now we get Jake! Oh boy, three people in my ear, definitely going to be easier to understand than two.
  * Jake you better not be as horny as Eric apparently is, and you'll be all good.
  * I have absolutely no idea which voice is Mike/Frank's and which is Jake, this is going to be fun
* HA, I made the Zack Snyder note above before Jake (Mike?) asked if Zack Snyder was on board, Zilla: _2_ PMI: 0.
* Has Eric ever finished a track without looking up at least one thing that arises as part of the watching? Guess we'll eventually know
* Everyone: Talking about Titanic 2, Eric: _humming Jurassic Park for no reason at all_.
* "They're gonna fuck like dolphins", well, at least it wasn't Eric this time?
* "That girl just died on the beach! From a neck bite?!!?!??"
* What beer is Jake drinking? These questions need answers
* WHICH VOICE IS JAKE'S AND WHICH VOICE IS MIKE'S
* "Hurricany Sandy? ... I lost power for a couple hours guys, it was rough" -- If only you had a mobile home or some place that could easily relocate to a place with power, Eric...
* "You gotta be really fucking stupid to die in this movie" - Well said, Mike (I think).
* I MADE THE STOOL JOKE FIRST, ONCE AGAIN ERIC, Zilla: 3 PMI: 0.
* "This is like Dark Knight music", how _fucking dare_ you try to relate this trash to Dark Knight.
* "You know what would be great SciFi movie? If while the sharknado was going on, the sharks just grew legs and started running around", "Yeah, just like centipedes!" OK, Eric, or, like any other thing that has (a more normal?) amount of legs.
* ASMR "Was it buttporn? Was it buttporn?" There we go, that's PMI I've come to know so far.
  * Also, I'm going to count "Fuck everything... that walks" as part of Eric (not) admitting to thinking of doing non-legal things, so now: **6**.
* Eric (not) admitting to thinking of doing non-legal things (CHILDREN'S bus driver orgy... WITH THE CHILDREN): **7**.
* I'm going to sharking shark my sharks out if I have to watch any sequels to this, please, PMI, don't have follow-ups for it...
* "They won't show kids being eaten by sharks, right? Right....??? IDK man, its 2013"
  * All the kiddos made it out, but that bus driver is 100% dying.
    * Beat you to it again, Eric, Zilla: 4 PMI: 0
* "What the hell is going on right now? I see no sharks, and I see no 'nados??" I agree with Eric, this movie has far too much non-shark-nor-nado content.
* Why does Jake need to go to _the overside of the house apparently_ to blow his nose?
* "Iceman froze semen on the side of him!!! I'm, I'm sorry, I'm having a flashback.." - Eric Striffler, 2013
