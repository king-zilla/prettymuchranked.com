### Score

* **High School Musical**: pre-watch guess **6.3/10** || **Post-watch score: 5.9/10**
  * "2006 American musical television film"; $4.2 million budget
  * Why's that one kid got like 5 watches on?
  * You know they wanted to hire Meryl Streep for the stage teacher but couldn't get her
  * At least the actors portraying the kids were somewhat close to their intended age, I guess
  * Are the twins like, into each other...?
  * The teacher's/dad's+coach's characters writings were... blech
  * WAIT ZAC EFRON DIDN'T EVEN SING THE WHOLE MOVIE????

* **Commentary: 7.8/10**
  * Most of thoughts are applicable so not going to reiterate here.
  * Why is Mike's singing voice a (Goblin? Ogre? ...? Waluigi at one point?)
  * The amount of pain Eric experiences throughout the whole watch-along because he just wants Mike and Jake to sing and love it as much as he does is \*chef's kiss\*
  * Not as funny as say, Oogieloves, IMO, though.

### Thoughts

> Previously...
> * Eric (not) admitting to thinking of doing non-legal things: **11**.

* Eric, Jake, Mike (_Eric, Mike, and Jake_, apparently) on today's track
* Eric is addicted to High School Musical (HSM), apparently. 11th? (at least) re-watch, supposedly
* "This is not just a commentary, but it's a sing-a-long, too. But... you guy's don't even know the lyrics!!" This is going to be a great idea, Eric, definitely
* "UGH, WE'RE ALREADY ABOUT TO SING??" two minutes into the movie, strap in, Mike
* Eric _definitely_ wanted to be Zac Efron when this movie came out, and you can't change my mind 
* "He looks like Zack and Cody... Look at that! ... (aggresively) _**so sexy**_"
* Little known fact, HSM was actually just a Star Wars spinoff
* MIKE ASMR VOICE APPEARANCE, 4/4
* "IT'S THE KID FROM HOLES!!! ... NO, IT IS" I'm _pretty_ sure that's racist, I think
* "She's almost pretty but she's got a weasel face ... I mean look at that side profile, **Jesus Christ**" - Jake
* Eric is _so_ dissapointed internally that Mike and Jake are ruining his favorite sing-along and I love it
* "Is that a real camel??" Mike asked, to the camel with 6 legs
* Eric just is trying so hard to keep Mike and Jake up to date on all the plot secrets and motions and it's so ~~great~~ hard to see him suffer
* "I realize I'm offending people but I don't give a RAT'S ASS" - Eric, while stereotypically pronouncing an Asian character's name
* THE CAMEL MADE A RE-APPEARANCE
* "Is that a student??? She's got a decent rack of lamb going on for a student" - Mike
  * Eric (well, Mike) (not) admitting to thinking of doing non-legal things: **12**.
* "Do I smell guys?? I'm sorry, I'm just getting so into it I'm perspiring" - I told you, Eric wants to be Efron confirmed
* "She's got those (ASMR voice) _dick sucking lips)_" - Mike
  * Eric (Mike) (not) admitting to thinking of doing non-legal things: **13**.
* "She looks like a Scooby-Doo character" She most definitely does
* I mean, really, you can physically feel the pain in Eric's voice when Mike's gremlin voice butchers each song
  * LOL so he just doesn't let Mike sing "Stick to the Status Quo"
* Eric (not) admitting to thinking of doing non-legal things (homeschooling with a hot mom): **14**.
* "What if someone was taking a piss in there?? Or just bleeding profusely from their vagina" - Eric
* "So... does he just carry a basketball around with him everywhere?" - Mike
* Eric Googling trivia/questions while the track is rolling... sigh, 4/4
* I just realized what Mike's singing voice sounds like and it's [Dr. Teeth from the Muppets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4PWbOAp8TQ)
* "I HAVE A RIGHT TO SEE MY SON... _DOWN THERE_" - Eric Striffler
