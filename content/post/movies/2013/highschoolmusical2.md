### Score

* **High School Musical 2**: pre-watch guess **6.3/10** || **Post-watch score: 4/10**
  * "2007 American musical television film"; $7 million budget"
  * If this movie would have kept all the songs/music numbers but was trimmed to be under 80 minutes, it probably would of been at least a 7.8/10.
  * Was there supposed to be some weird implied sexual tension between ~~the LS guy~~ Mr. Fulton and Sharpay or...?
  * I agree with Jake, this movie's plot is not nearly as good as HSM1
  * The Lava Springs setting was just weirdly deserted and felt empty and akward
  * It took 5 weeks to film this... huh
  * At least Efron sang all of his songs this time I guess? ... even though they feel akward and forced at times

* **Commentary: 4/10**
  * Most of thoughts are applicable so not going to reiterate here.
  * 50% of the track was just Jake thirsting _**hard**_ over Sharpay (...)
    * The other 50% is Eric still trying to get the guys as invested into the HSM series as he is
  * There wasn't a ton of funny content, but that's mostly because IMO the movie was just a wet noodle so didn't provide much good material
  * All I can say is I'm glad for PMI's sake that they didn't have the version with "Humu Humu Nuku Nuku Apua" in it to review because that would of been rough
  * "This undercuts that movie, that we are not invested _at all_; we don't even care what they're saying"
    * Jake about sums it up with this one
  * "I can't tell what's a bigger disaster, the movie or the commentary"
    * Jake's words, not mine

### Thoughts

> Previously...
> * Eric (not) admitting to thinking of doing non-legal things: **14**.

* Eric, Jake, Mike on today's track
* 10 seconds in and Eric is already trying to get Mike and Jake to pay attention to details to appreciate the series
* Eric (not) admitting to thinking of doing non-legal things ("oh my god she just had an orgasm", of the _high school girl_): **15**.
* "He's still got dumb shirts with dumb sayings..." - Mike, "Furthering the stereotype about LAZY BLACK PEOPLE" - Eric
* Multiple-universes tangent? Which is somehow applicable to the movie, according to Mike
* "Somethng about white girls... I just don't like 'em" - Jake
* Mike ASMR voice appearance, 5/5
* Jake has announced how much more attractive Ashley Tisdale is in this movie everytime (~6) she's appeared on screen
* "Look at that one fucker with the tuba", "NO! There's _two_ fuckers with a tuba!"
* Eric and Mike making fun of Jake's daddy problems mercilessly
* Lava Springs is Radiator Springs, confirmed
* "He's like, I'm gonna hookup with this underage biiiitch"
* > (Speaking of the _underage Sharpay Evans in the initial Lava Springs music number_)
  >
  > "So.. how you feeling about her chest there?"
  > 
  > "It's alright?"
  >
  > "Sorry to all the girls watching, looking down thinking Jake won't have sex with these..."
* "Whats more embarrasing? Having a party to watch HSM2 with your friends **_OR_** jerking off to LOTR while playing D&D??"
* How far did Eric shove the mic into his mouth to immitate the chocking sounds? _my gosh_
* "HEY! Look at his underballs!" - Eric
* I agree with Jake, this movie's plot is so far not nearly as good as HSM1.
* Why does everytime a song breaks out after about 20 seconds into the song it devolves to Eric or Mike _SCREAMING_ the next X seconds of lyrics ???
* "Urban dance elements; break-dancing, parkouring... they didn't have that in the first one! 5/10"
* Fun fact: Mike and Eric used to make intros to their high school PA system, and one of the days they did Troy Bolton Tuesday
* Eric (not) admitting to thinking of doing non-legal things ("you gotta practice getting things in your mouth, baby"): **16**.
* "That was the most sexual punch in I've ever seen", "What'd he do it with, his penis???"
* Fun fact 2: Eric love's raglan shirts
* Conspiracy that Mike and Jake have secretly seen HSM1 and HSM2 and are just lying to Eric
* Informative tidbit about what and the origin of The Streisand effect, nice
* "Look at how tight her (Sharpay) body is, she's incredible. She's tan, she's perfect" - Jake
  * Eric (Jake) (not) admitting to thinking of doing non-legal things: **17**.
  * "Look up Ashley Tisdale naked"
    * ... **18**
  * "(ASMR voice) I WANNA SEE INSIDE OF HER"
    * ... **19**
* Eric (Jake) (not) admitting to thinking of doing non-legal things ("Her vagina is just spread ALL the way open"): **20**.
* "Apparently if you have sex inside a pool, **_you can die_**!" - Jake
* "Isn't it like he/she/Z?" Nope, not quite Eric
* "I can't - he's singing too fast" - Jake, "It's a rap; it's a black people song" - Eric
* "Look at her rumpus! look at her rumpus! I CAN SEE WHERE SHE POOPS FROM"
* "When you have your period, where does your poop come from"?
  * ... "When you have to poop, where does your period come from?"
* Really weird tangent about Sharpay being able to crush rocks into marbles? diamonds? harder rocks? with her crotch.
* Eric (Jake) (not) admitting to thinking of doing non-legal things (scarring discussion between Mr. Fulton and Taylor): **21**.
* Mike pretending to be a walrus while Eric is so excited and trying to ignore it with all his willpower for Bet On It is beautiful
* Eric googling questions/trivia while the track is running, 5/5.
* "I know this is a bit off topic but I have a wealth of 9/11 jokes to share with you" - Eric
* Once again, a song breaks out and after about 20 seconds into the song it devolves to Eric or Mike _SCREAMING_ the next X seconds of lyrics
* "Keep your eyes peeled! If you miss Miley Cyrus we have to start over from scratch", "Eric, I swear to God" - Jake
