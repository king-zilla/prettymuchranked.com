### Score

* **High School Musical 3**: pre-watch guess **6.9/10** || **Post-watch score: 7.2/10**
  * "2007 American musical film", the third and final installment in the High School Musical franchise: $11 million budget"
  * It's crazy what money can do to production quality (and soundtrack, wow)
  * Cast all around better acting since now are actual matured actors
  * The limo boarding scene, _pinches fingers, mwah_
    * Really, whole prom number (choreography) was good
  * "The University of Berkeley offers me... **both**" _Pan to focus, Dad proudly beats chest_ 

* **Commentary: 5/10**
  * Most of thoughts are applicable so not going to reiterate here.
  * We ended up watching the _unedited_ track since had it downloaded locally from way back still, and uh, yeah, I can see why they went back and edited the tracks
  * Is it Zach Efr**on** or Zach "Efrin"??
  * "I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THE SONG" - Jake, on Right Here Right Now, but really could be the whole trilogy
  * This commentary was maybe 90% random banter and 10% HSM commentary
  * "You know what I used to have for lunch in the cafeteria? **FIGHTS**"
  * WE HATE JUSTIN BIEBER
  * Viewer discretion advisory (checks watch) an hour and 10 minutes into the movie haha
  * "OH! It's Kid Rock!"

### Thoughts

> Previously...
>
> * Eric (not) admitting to thinking of doing non-legal things: **20**.
> * Eric googling questions/trivia while the track is running, 5/5

* Eric, Jake, Mike on today's track
* "Is there singing in this??" "**OF COURSE THERE IS, IT'S HIGH SCHOOL _MUSICAL_, you drip**"
* Mike and Jake thouroughly tired of HSM by this point, Eric still trying (and failing) to get them to like it as much as he "did" (_does_)
* "Are they all 16?" "_I **hope** so_..." - Eric
* Eric (Jake) (not) admitting to thinking of doing non-legal things (dicks everywhere at a highschool party): **21**.
* "I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THE SONG" - Jake
* "Oh yeah, she's looking pretty...." "Pretty what?" "Pretty!" - Jake
* "English (UK) people are the mexicans of the movie industry" Yikes
* Fun fact: They played the sound of a car crash every 30 minutes to remind the children of the frequency of drunk driving at Eric's school
* "I hate, I fucking hate, as an intelligent person, being grouped in with morons ... IM BETTER THAN **MANY** PEOPLE ... I'm eating Mcdonalds right now and I'm well above it. I walk in there, look em in the eyes and say I'm better than this; **I'll have fries**." 
* Jake's mom still doing his laundry at 25? 26? not shocking
* "I was given a gift, god granted me the gift of _hair_" - Eric (in context of talking about confidence to wear top X buttons undone)
* "YO YO YO ITS LUNCH TIME MOTHERFUCKERRRRR" - Eric
* _Eric singing, laughing in the background_ "FUCK OFF THIS IS THE BEST SON- oh, you're laughing at your watch" - Eric
* Eric googling questions/trivia while the track is running, 6/6!! (Yes, "baseball shirts" are Raglans)
* "How many times have you seen this?" "Just once!" That's definitely a lie Eric

* Eric (not) admitting to thinking of doing non-legal things: **22**.
  * "Imagine being a little girl and like losing your mind watching this, just soaking up the movie theatre seat." - Eric
  * "Eric... oh my god jesus christ" - Jake

*  "Did you guys know girls poop? She poops!" - Mike
* "Can we give some advice to some young PMI viewers?? If you think of a fedora and it being cool, just, no"
